            <description>We consider the news that BMW's i3 will revert to metal in its next iteration.  A question of business models engages much of our conversation, from optimized cars designed for transportation as a service to dynamic routes, pricing and arrival options.   Dyson's rumored auto ambitions divert our attention.  We close by musing on the utility of big data and the evolution of transportation.

            <description>Does the automotive supply chain drive strategy?  What are the new product implications of legacy supply chains?  Are organizations bound to supply chain practices?   Does Toyota's supply chain structure give them a market advantage?

                Why does the Fiat 500's CarPlay work well, but a Chrysler Minivan not at all?

                We discuss the cultural, safety, legal and engineering aspects of motorcycles and their smaller cousins.

            <description>Would you buy this car?

                We begin with a discussion of recent announcements and deal making.  Horace questions our four wheel obsession and wonders if the next platform origin might surprise us.

                The Economist recently asserted that data is the new oil.

                We consider this statement in light of recent consortiums, from automotive linux to maps and data sharing schemes.

                We note Asymcar's fourth anniversary and reflect a bit on earlier shows, including Richard Marks Eco-V (Asymcar 8) and David Levinson (Asymcar 7).

            <description>Does place matter?

                We consider geography, the hype cycle and S curves while reflecting on what is perhaps, at present a "phoney war"(1).

                Does geography play a role in disruption?  Are "hyped" optics necessary for the new new thing?

                What skills are required for disruptive innovation in and around the auto ecosystem?  How do cycle times (2) color our outlook?

                A good conversation.

            <description>Cycle times loom larger in the clash of the automotive and smartphone eco-systems.  We reflect on BMW's i brand again, while the company appears to retrench and focus on their legacy facilities and cars.

                We divert a bit into a discussion of new vs better and the business strategy supporting such choices.

                Finally, financialization looms, perhaps an opening during the next downturn.

                the last 5 minutes disappeared into the ether.. sorry.

            <description>Joe Rosmann shares his experience and perspective on our changing transportation system - "the most regulated industry we have".

                Joe begins with three points:


                Car costs continue to grow
                Smartphones.  Consumers can make dynamic real time choices about the best way to go from a to b 24 hours per day, 7 days per week (see the City Mapper app).
                Autonomous vehicles can make lives safer and faster.



                We close and reflect on Joe's assertion that "Algorithms are going to become regulatory mandated standards".

            <description>Sam Abuelsamid reflects on the origins of BMW's i program, today's economics and the application of lessons learned.

                We veer into supply chain details and consider the path that the legacy automakers have chosen.

                The show closes with a discussion of Apple's entry assets, supply chain power and business model evolution.

            <description>Anton Wahlman joins us as we dive into numbers, production curves and the clash between reality, vision and hubris over autonomous cars

                Tesla's "financial equation" merits much discussion interspersed with reflections on an EV landscape littered with government subsidies.

                We close with accounting, including a dissertation on variable costs and the burden of "dealerless" car sales.

                Beginning with Henry Ford’s “Old Fashioned Layaway Plan” followed by the launch of General Motors Acceptance Corporation, the Certified Pre-Owned sleight of hand and today’s auto sales finance and reporting controversies all shaped the industry. Finance is one of many vectors which tie the system together into what its is.

                We once again explore the other vectors that might open disruptive opportunities for an entrant. Wide ranging discussion touching all the big points ultimately asking whether Big Bang change is coming. Or will it the big whimper?

            <description>Horace and Jim begin with the industry's rhetorical bubble.  We consider the auto eco-system's atmospherics on auto companions and quickly revert back to the reality of today's manufacturing practices and industry lead times.

                Horace notes the early development of steam, electric and internal combustion engine cars.  We discuss the external assets that sustained the engines we use today and what might change in the near term to support significant electric vehicle (EV) growth.

                We close in contemplation of Uber's purported 100,000 unit S-Class purchase.

            <description>Announcements arrive with regularity.

                Ford and Google reveal plans to cooperate on autonomous cars.  Toyota's aims to begin "precision mapping" roads.    Ford zigs in another direction and eyes CityMapper's terrain with its proposed "Dynamic Shuttle" service.

                So much slideware.

                Horace dives into the data.   EV and hybrid cars currently represent a tiny fraction of the market.   OPEC recently forecast that by 2040, 94 percent of the vehicles on the world's roads will still be powered by fossil fuels. Bullish, Horace sees greater EV penetration, with modularity powering double digit market share.

                Current auto business models trade a few points of marginal cost in return for double digit marginal revenue, resulting in brand explosion.

                We await the Lamborghini SUV.

                &lt;p&gt;So much slideware.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Horace dives into the data.   EV and hybrid cars currently represent a tiny fraction of the market.   OPEC recently forecast that by 2040, 94 percent of the vehicles on the world's roads will still be powered by fossil fuels. Bullish, Horace sees greater EV penetration, with modularity powering double digit market share.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Current auto business models trade a few points of marginal cost in return for double digit marginal revenue, resulting in brand explosion.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>We consider the landscape that Apple's purported Titan project will address in a few years time.

                Horace discusses the pattern of disruption powered by Moore's law.  We turn to the transportation sector and consider the "reimagining" of the car.  We further consider scenarios, from sustaining where the current players grow, to new entrant opportunities.

                The conversation diverts a bit into the regulatory and taxation regime, specifically  US road funding is largely tied to fuel taxes.   We note the odd situation where an entry level car driver pays fuel taxes while a luxury Tesla driver does not.

                We speculate on Apple's possible "meaningful contribution" to transportation and the required product, customer experience, sales channel, price and financing options.

            <description>We begin a speculative show in Berlin, where a cab driver laments “young people arriving in the city to party and sleep on couches”. Might Berlin’s youthful visitors in 2050 simply crash in their autonomous pods? Horace races forward and muses on a future filled with roving, autonomous Winnebagos. Jim notes that there have been previous attempts at such vehicles, particularly with 1960’s and 1970’s era vans. Big data and algorithms run interference. Will autonomous pod players be naturally limited to those who can create and maintain a global mapping system? Today, those organizations include Google, Apple and a consortium owned by Audi, BMW and Mercedes. TomTom supplies GIS data to many organizations and Uber has begun to collect mapping data as well. We close with a bit of Apple gazing. What might Apple’s first car look like? What is its job to be done? Will it be influenced by the VW Beetle? asymcar.com Asymcar River of News

            <description>Mathew Desmond joins us to discuss Cars Online 2015 - The Selfie Experience. The evolving power of the connected customer. We begin with the fascinating finding that “One-half of customers are interested in buying a car from a tech company like Apple or Google. This is true even of customers who are satisfied with their current brand and dealer experience. It is particularly true of young customers (65%) and those in growth markets (China: 74%; India: 81%).” Backing up a bit, we discuss the automaker’s dilemma, that is the legacy manufacturing, distribution and support infrastructure and contrast that with the “clean slate” approach an entrant might enjoy. The concept and inherent conflicts of a “Master Customer Record” fuels a deeper dive into “Continuity”, the buyer’s desire for a seamless experience. Finally, we reflect on the perils that may lie ahead as the auto ecosystem attempts to improve the retail experience. asymcar.com Asymcar River of News.

            <description>We revisit “Antennagate”. Should organizations hire people with industry skills and experience or capable, driven outsiders? Horace shares tales from Henry Ford’s personnel practices during the Model T to Model A transition. The conversation accelerates into a discussion of aesthetics and jobs to be done. We muse on Tesla’s development, supply chain, aesthetics and market position while contrasting that with Toyota’s introduction of the Prius. We close with speculation on what a “meaningful contribution” to the auto ecosystem might look like.

            <description>We consider Uber’s street smarts, “cash on the hood” driver acquisition tactics and their ability to operate over the top, that is above local regulations and norms. The proposed elimination of diesel cars in Paris and London ignites a side trip through today’s regulatory labyrinth. Horace reflects on a recent Tesla test drive while evaluating innovation on jobs to be done, form factor design, production methods and their business model. Jim considers Sandy Munro’s recent BMW i3 teardown, which lead him to conclude that “this car makes money”. Might BMW have leaped ahead of Tesla while pumping out 500,000 traditional 3 series this year? We close with news that Porsche has once again rejected an “entry level” sports car project. This, despite their growing SUV and large car portfolio.

            <description>What motivates a company to destroy its brand? We start with Mini’s plans to sell 100,000 cars in the States by 2020, nearly double today’s pace and remember how Cadillac destroyed their brand and how Mercedes, Porsche, Ferrari et. al. can’t wait to do the same. Also, might retail power in the form of strong dealer regulation limit brand’s ability to improve or address customer experiences? What motivated Warren Buffet to enter the American car dealer business? (With a long aside on what Buffett investment logic is all about and why it’s not contradictory to a growth investor). We detour a bit into the information battle to come and how car makers yearn to be the masters of their own cars.

            <description>Part I is a review of the “automotive stack” and note how there is no singular event that seems to affect disruptive change. From changing jobs to be done, modular design and manufacturing processes, powertrain evolution, urbanization, environmental interests, regulation and taxation. Part II is a review of a framework of analysis based on sources and uses of energy. Inputs, efficiency/losses, network effects and inertia, what can change and what can’t change. For a shot of theory, Horace reflects on the dichotomy of efficiency vs. efficacy when it comes to predicting change in the sector.

            <description>Steve Crandall joins us to discuss hydrogen fuel cells vs. lithium batteries. The two alternatives to post-internal-combustion motoring are far harder to assess than it might seem. Both require systems analysis and the systems themselves need to be weighed against the incumbent infrastructure and jobs to be done. We begin with Toyota’s fuel cell sedan announcement and recall Honda’s Clarity. The conversation leads to the observation that technical merit is not always sufficient or even necessary to market adoption success. We note that Toyota supported the Prius through years of low volume. Steve compares this to ATT’s abandonment of a cell service in the 1990?s. Steve compares the energy performance of hydrogen and gasoline and shares a look at the economic conditions necessary for a successful hydrogen fuel cell launch.

Matt introduces us to Solar X, the solar car challenge. He reflects on these emerging technologies in light of Australia’s nearly extinct auto manufacturing sector. We explore the concept of a car as the home power source and consider possible EV disruption of traditional power generation and distribution concerns. The potential business models arising from these emerging technologies makes us pause in light of solar firm’s stock performance.

            <description>On continental road trips, joys of rear wheel drive, diesel engines and autobahn speeds, pilgrimage to Porsche and BMW’s brand meccas. How to understand the world through toy cars, from Matchbox to Hot Wheels, Siku, Majorette to Tomica. Jim returns to the business of car distribution with an Alfred Sloan quote: “Between 1923–29 the leveling of demand for new cars logically resulted in a change of emphasis in the industry from production to distribution. On the sales end that meant a change from easy selling to hard selling. Dealer problems of an entirely new nature began to arise.” We consider car dealer data and discuss the “channel stuffing” origins of state franchise regulation. Horace reminds us that the current auto industry is constructed around production and distribution. We close by reflecting on Apple’s routing around now defunct computer retail channels via its highly successful stores, just 13 years ago.

            <description>Jim shares the joys of two recent rural road trips. The changing landscape, from discarded bank buildings and big box stores to a lack of traffic on these roads offers an opportunity to reflect on the atrophying auto eco-system. Horace notes the behavior changes leading to reduced use of autos. Alternatives, including bicycles, public transport, walking and car sharing services can be used to move atoms in a more efficient and environmentally friendly manner. Jim reflects on Ford’s $1,500,000 facility subsidy to a small town car dealership – in a community that lacks a grocery or clothing store. Perhaps the growing American use of “subprime” auto loans to “move the metal” explains the bricks and mortar strategy. Horace counters that people are figuring out ways to get things done without moving atoms. We marvel – again – at the industry’s glacial pace of change and contrast the auto industry’s tiny volumes to smartphones and personal computers. We conclude with a look at today’s youth culture and consider the sense that driving is for old people.

            <description>We explore the strategic and tactical considerations behind BMW’s i sub-brand. Why did BMW attach a new BMW sub-brand to a new powertrain rather than using another brand, like Mini? The answer helps explain how innovations and brands inter-relate and how incumbents can attempt to absorb what is potentially non-sustaining. We consider the pros and cons of innovation within an operating business – “intrepreneurship” – compared with creating an autonomous enterprise for the “new new thing”. Horace contrasts BMW i with General Motors’ failed Saturn experiment and notes that today, GM offers a mainstream plug-in car through the long serving Chevrolet brand and sales channel. We consider the burden that regulation, girth, cycle times, legacy practices, financialization and strategy taxes place on incumbents. Finally, we look at what it takes to cross over the line which separates the device-based nice-to-have infotainment options from the must-have driver and ownership assistants that will inevitably find home in these devices.

            <description>The orthodox vs. the unorthodox: Tata, Tesla and Toyota. Why might an asymmetric competitor lose and a symmetric competitor win? We begin with Tesla and Apple. We continue with aluminum vehicles and re-visit information asymmetry as Horace exploits it to buy a Mercedes on eBay. We talk about car APIs (Aux input jack and ODBII). Jim muses on the risks used car buyers face from eye-watering transmission costs to the parallels between iPhone mules and American citizens recently prosecuted for flipping new German cars to buyers in mainland China. A brief discussion considers the perils of endless line extension up and down the market, perhaps fueled by financialization. We close by considering the track record and business models of recent “disruptive” entrants from Toyota’s Prius to Tesla and the Renault (Dacia) Logan.

            <description>Horace and Jim discuss shopping online for used cars and how and why the value of cars disappears so quickly. The conversation drifts into information asymmetry, the declining interest in auto maintenance and the perpetual closed-loop auto information model. We hypothesize on the impact of the coming self-monitoring and awareness of the lives of vehicles. Finally we ask whether the dysfunction in the industry is the cause or the effect of the ancient integrated factory model and the sustaining auto eco-system incentives that impede transformation. Finally, we note Gordon Murray’s iStream vision and the deal with Yamaha.

            <description>Richard Marks, a battle-hardened veteran of the electric vehicle wars, joins Horace and Jim in Asymcar 8. Our exploration considers the lessons of General Motors’ EV1 and subsequent conversion initiatives. We charge into the organizational, distribution and regulatory dynamics that sustain the long-serving Henry Ford production system. We reflect a bit on Tesla’s use of this century old production model. Richard galvanizes the conversation with a description of his EcoV concept. The disruptive potential of its modular design, impressive economics and off the shelf components sparks a look at potential urban markets, from delivery vehicles to car sharing services. We close with a discussion of the investment and distribution climate for disruptive vehicles such as the EcoV.

            <description>Steve Crandall brings a new perspective as a guest. Steve’s analysis of complex systems has given him a huge pool of wisdom into which we dip our dainty spoons. We survey the interlopers seeking to replace many jobs that cars have traditionally done, from horses to bicycles, planes, trains and buses. We dive deeper into a few earlier Asymcar topics including energy, regulation, infrastructure, power train evolution, societal changes, distribution networks, urbanization and consider the promise of electric bicycles. Several innovation timing lessons temper our expectations for immediate improvements. Finally, we revisit the emerging transportation information layer and how such services may change public behavior and the auto-ecosystem.

            <description>Of Phaetons, Coupés, Shooting Brakes, Broughams, Hackneys, Cabriolets, Landaus and Limousines. Horace and Jim step back in time to revisit the raison d’être for carriages and the emerging “horseless” carriage. We explore how evolution rather than revolution of networks influenced the technologies of transportation. The question of foothold markets comes up and we explore which jobs-to-be-done affected early car design. The leap from these early jobs to the modern segmentation of the market is observed through Henry Ford’s approach to the then agrarian market compared with Alfred Sloan’s portfolio strategy at General Motors. The discussion morphs into a brief infrastructure review where the development of roads is compared to today’s telco operator business and regulatory models. Finally, Horace and Jim drift into insurance and discuss the risk pooling implications of driverless cars.

            <description>Are cars sold or purchased? Horace Dediu and Jim Zellmer discuss automotive “ecosystems” vis-à-vis Apple and Tesla’s direct sales model. We further dive into the rigidity and risk of such value chains and divert a bit into automakers’ attempts at aviation. Finally, we consider the potential monetization of automotive metadata and what that might mean for new, perhaps “over the top” style entrants.

            <description>Horace Dediu and Jim Zellmer discuss the pleasures of traversing continents by road. This leads to a grand tour of powertrains, composites, fuel efficiency, regulation and Tesla’s luxury market entry. Which naturally leads to a conversation on emerging auto modularization, apps and ecosystems and where value will accrue.

            <description>Horace Dediu and Jim Zellmer discuss the odds of disrupting the present automotive club via Tesla. We further dive into the regulatory and cultural environment that sustains the current players, while reflecting a bit on Segway, Toyota’s Winglet, organ donors and the Fiat “multiair” engine. Finally, we preview a larger discussion on apps in and around the car.
